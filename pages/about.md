## **About Digital Hogarth**  


### Platform Static Site 
Digital Hogarth uses the [CollectionBuilder static site](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) developed by [the University of Idaho Library](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/) system. We chose to use the platform because it uses the jekyll framework which provides a minimal computing opportunity to present a digital collection with images and associated data. The framework can utilize project data from google sheets and provide a dynamic experience and a pleasing, accessible interface for users.  


### Subjects
The project team decided to use the categories of portrait; ticket; shopcard; book illustration; bookplate; frontispiece; sign; satire; historical, religious or literary work; conversation piece; and a work on moral instruction as categories for our subjects page and in our image data. These categories present valuable information about the function, forms, and themes of Hogarth’s work, helping our users explore the variety within our collection.

### Data
For this project we used images from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, WikiMedia, and other sources. Metadata and categorization applied to these images comes from these sources along with the project team’s own classification of Hogarth’s work and its forms, functions, content, and historical context. Descriptions associated with images in our data page come from these sources as well as..
[Data friends add more? Developing more text and sources for descriptions on our own? Will discuss!]

### The Project Team
This is a class project for IS-578: Introduction to Digital Humanities at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign School of Information Sciences taught by Professor Zoë LeBlanc in Fall 2022. This digital project was created by April, Dan, Daniel, Daniela, and Owen for an audience of scholars or interested individuals to view and explore a repository of Hogarth artwork images. We want to express our gratitude to our instructor, course guest speakers, and classmates for providing guidance, inspiration, critical perspectives, and invaluable feedback to this project in its development, theory, and practical construction.

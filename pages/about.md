## About Digital Hogarth

This is a class project for IS-578: Introduction to Digital Humanities. We are using the CollectionBuilder static site to create a usable digital image and data repository for William Hogarth artwork images. 

This digital project was created by April, Dan, Daniel, Daniela, and Owen for an audience of scholars or interested individuals to view and explore a repository of Hogarth artwork images.

The data and images for this project was developed through online museum sources, public domain images, and the group's categorization and contextualization of Hogarth's work.

## **Critical Context**  

<p>
<br>
</p>

Many William Hogarth artworks contain an oppressive iconographical system of images depicting people of color. 
Some Hogarth works, such as [_A Turkish Bath_](https://digitalhogarth.github.io/item.html?id=coll080), fit the description of “Orientalism,” 
constructed by postcolonial critics and Art History scholars. Other Hogarth works, such as [_Plate 2 (Quarrels with Her Jew Collector)_](https://digitalhogarth.github.io/item.html?id=coll009) 
and [_The Toilette / The Duchess’ Morning Levee_](https://digitalhogarth.github.io/item.html?id=coll025) depict individuals of African descent 
as servants or enslaved individuals within British society. In these images, Hogarth depicts people of Middle Eastern and 
African descent in denigrating positions of inferiority or servitude without respect towards the cultures or people depicted.

In this section we provide important critical context to help visitors understand the historical oppressive and colonial 
context to Hogarth’s work and British art of his era. These sources and quotes are by no means an exhaustive exploration 
of the literature on the colonial imagery of Hogarth and his era. We offer these perspectives to contextualize our collection, 
present a glimpse into the conversation surrounding Hogarth and representation, and to provide visitors with a path to further 
critical exploration of Art History. Inspired by Dr Roopika Risam’s proposals in her text _New Digital Worlds_, we aim to resist 
uncritically reinscribing incorrect, offensive, and colonial ways of seeing and presenting the culture of others.

### **Critical Perspectives**  

<p>
<br>
</p>

#### Edward Said - _Orientalism_ 


<blockquote>  “The Orient is not only adjacent to Europe; it is also the place of Europe's greatest and richest and oldest colonies, 
the source of its civilizations and languages, its cultural contestant, and one of its deepest and most recurring images 
of the Other. In addition, the Orient has helped to define Europe (or the West) as its contrasting image, idea, 
personality, experience. Yet none of this Orient is merely imaginative. The Orient is an integral part of European material 
civilization and culture. Orientalism expresses and represents that part culturally and even ideologically 
as a mode of discourse with supporting institutions, vocabulary, scholarship, imagery, doctrines, even colonial 
bureaucracies and colonial styles.“ </blockquote>

#### Linda Nochlin - “The Imaginary Orient”

<blockquote>  “The white man, the Westerner, is of course always implicitly present in Orientalist paintings like the Snake Charmer; 
his is necessarily the controlling gaze, the gaze which brings the Oriental world into being, the gaze for which it is 
ultimately intended.“ </blockquote>

#### Peter Wagner - “Hogarth and the Other”

<blockquote>  “Hogarth’s artistic representation of the Other was shaped by and in turn shaped the contemporary Enlightenment discourse 
in word and image about what was not English, not ‘normal’ (human, sane, heterosexual) and not adult. If we find xenophobia, 
gynophobia and racism galore in Hogarth’s works, it is because his graphic art engages with the stereotypes produced by 
early-eighteenth-century discourse in England. Hogarth’s prints hold them up to the spectator from a moral position 
firmly grounded in Augustan English satire. Before focusing on particular examples of visual satire on otherness, 
I should perhaps briefly outline the large field this otherness comprises: it concerns the exotic/alien and the non-English 
in general (Continental Europeans such as the French, but also Jews, Africans, Muslims, Asians, and American Indians) 
as well as marginalized social groups such as children, the insane, gays/lesbians and castrati. In what follows, I shall 
limit my analysis to a closer look at the function of some blacks in the visual rhetoric of Hogarth’s graphic art. 
If my focus is on Africans, it is to show that the Hogarthian creation of Englishness, and especially of English masculinity, 
depends to a substantial degree on the incorporation of stereotypes of that Other.” </blockquote>

<blockquote>  “Some of the generally shared attitudes towards blacks – part of the English mentalité, one might argue – reappear in 
Hogarth’s art: the African as (non-European) observer, as the dangerous Other, and as the inferior slave. 
Significantly, when we find Africans depicted in Hogarth’s art, what strikes one immediately is both the reflection 
of their inferior social position and their subsidiary role in Western art. Especially in painting, blacks were frequently 
likened to animals and figure as mere foils reflecting (and reflecting on) the superiority of Europeans. Hogarth’sgraphic 
art engages critically both with social history and with art history by drawing our attention to the stereotyped depiction 
of Africans while boosting their seemingly peripheral role in art and life. More than involving an erudite nod at artistic 
convention, as David Dabydeen would see it, Africans are an important part of his satirical narrative.” </blockquote>

#### Felicity A. Nussbaum - “Between ‘Oriental’ and ‘Blacks So Called’, 1688 - 1788”

<blockquote>  “[I]n Hogarth the subtle sexual connections between effete English people of ‘quality’, East Indian page, and sub-Saharan 
servant enhance and complicate the satire…. These texts provide indices by which we can gauge the formation of racial 
thinking during the English emancipation of African slaves and the growth of empire.” </blockquote> 

<blockquote>  “[I]n Plate 4 of Hogarth’s Marriage A-La-Mode, ‘The Toilette’, commentators often draw parallels between the two black 
servants attending the lady’s levée (link to image). They apply conventions about Africans and slaves to both figures 
without distinguishing between them or contextualizing the younger page within Eastern conventions. If we assume that 
both figures may be interpreted solely through the Black Atlantic triangle, rather than incorporating ‘the East’ within 
their blackness, we miss important metaphoric connections and differences.” </blockquote>

#### The Yale Center for British Art

[The Yale Center for British Art’s exhibition Slavery and Portraiture in 18th Century Atlantic Britain](https://interactive.britishart.yale.edu/slavery-and-portraiture/objects) provides valuable contextualization of some of Hogarth’s work within the larger art production of the 18th Century Britain. This collection includes scholarly perspectives that examine the influence of colonial empire and slavery on the artworks selected, while including objects of challenge and resistance to these oppressive social systems.

#### _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Colonialism_ – Section 5: "Post-Colonial Theory"

<blockquote>  "The term orientalism described a structured set of concepts, assumptions, and discursive practices that were used to produce, interpret, and evaluate knowledge about non-European peoples. Said’s analysis made it possible for scholars to deconstruct literary and historical texts in order to understand how they reflected and reinforced the imperialist project…
Said emphasizes that it is also a mode of exercising authority by organizing and classifying knowledge about the Orient. 
This discursive approach is distinct both from the materialist view that knowledge is simply a reflection of economic or political interests and from the idealist view that scholarship is disinterested and neutral. Following Foucault, 
Said describes discourse as a form of knowledge that is not used instrumentally in service of power but rather is itself a form of power.” </blockquote>
